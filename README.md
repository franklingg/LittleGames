Games I've been coding while I learn programming

## TicTacToe
A nostalgic Tic Tac Toe game made with Pygame. Not only a simple game, it has a good soundtrack (it may be a little annoying if you play too much)




## Jôtun's Path 
In this epic adventure Gjafar, our hero, is on a epic mission for the Æsir gods. He is crossing whole Jôtunheim (Norse World of the Giants), facing scary enemies with his friend, Bloodborne, his sword.
